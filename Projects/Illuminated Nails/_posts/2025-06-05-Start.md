## A bit of background

A while ago i concepted a project to embed RGB LEDs into press on nails. A friend was trying a similar idea, only using NFC coils to wirelessly transmit power to the LEDs. My approach was to use soe lightweight electronics in a sort of harness and incorporate it into the design of the piece, more like a harness/glove.

# Version#0

The first step to prove the concept was get all the components together and get some scrappy code achieving the effect i want. I had a bunch of RP2040 Zeros, which had a small ws2812b indicator and connected it to a MPU-6050 to get motion data. This worked perfectly so i immediately moved to integration.

# Version#1

I opted for EasyEDA, as it offered the quickest learning curve to design to production. I combined all the parts from the prototype, as well as a connection FPC ribbon and LED module to embed into a press on nail.

This version unfortunately had a few problems. I had mixed up the footprint of the USB-C and had an error with the data lines, was missing i2c pullup resistors and the FPC connector only worked in one orientation. These were all fixable* in the next revision, which i am working on at the time of writing, but in the meantime i was able to test the fitting of the harness.
