# The problem

For a while now I have been in need of a good repository for showcasing my works. Ive had too many project that Ive done, shown off to my friends and then never let them see the light of day again. Additionally professional record documents like my resume have too many times been unmaintained until right before applying for a job.

# Solution

So along comes building a website.

# How?

This site is hosted using Github pages ([Source](https://github.com/Cryaniptic/Cryaniptic.github.io)) and the theme has been adapted from [Lightspeed](https://github.com/tajacks/lightspeed). 

# Whats next?

TODO:
- Tweak styling (improve readability, colour adjustements)
- History navigation bar (e.g [silas](/)/[posts](/posts)/[this-site](/projects/2025/05/30/This-Site.html))
- UPLOAD ALL MY PROJECTS ðŸ˜­
- Better about me (resume sorta info)
- Media compression
- Landing page?
- Sort out some of the backend stuff (analyitics, streamlining publishing/post)
