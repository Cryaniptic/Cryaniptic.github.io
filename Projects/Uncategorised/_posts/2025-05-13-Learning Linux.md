title: Learning to use linux
---

Kind of for a while now ive been meaning to submerse myself in the rabbit 
hole that is linux. Some words that stuck with me when talking to a tutor at university when arguing as a first year does about if i should or should learn 
something were "arguably embedded development needs to know linux more than anyone, someday you may have to fix a problem in a deployed machine, in which case 
you *need* to be able to navigate, understand and use the basic tools that come with linux".

It took me a while, but with the recent undertaking of making a 
[replacement mother board for a old thinkpad]({% post_url 
2025-06-02-Begin %}), i feel this it was the 
perfect place to start. Ive been using the carrier board the lattepanda 
Mu came with to get a basic setup going, installing Arch and then 
promptly falling down yet another rabbit hole of ricing. Its not much but 
its a pretty start. Now ive actually got to start using this OS for 
something useful :/
